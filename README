Simple python script to monitor changes for a webpage!

Tired of always being the last to know about something (SLOWPOKE) Well this is for you! (as long as you know what you want to look for)

It works by pulling the page, hashing it and comparing the hash with an original hash

Reqs:
pygooglevoice - python wrapper for google voice
cron - if you want it to check every so often

Setup:
run getHash.py to fetch the original hash of the page

copy the original hash into the originalPageHash variable in pageNotifier.py

copy the url of the webpage (along with http://) to the pageToCheck variable in pageNotifier.py

save an array of phone numbers to text when the page changes

fill in the details of the .gvoice file and move it to your directory

run the script on a cron job ( 0,30 * * * * python /location/to/pageNotifer.py )

Enjoy!


This script was made for the hp touchpad page, LOL!
